## Curriculum

> […] development of a compiler for a simple, procedural programming language

<aside class="notes">
As stated by the curriculum, your task is to build a simple compiler for a small procedural programming language.
It's quite hard to fit this goal into the 5 ECTS budget of this module (lecture included), nevertheless I think I found the right trade-offs with the given specification.

Still, it is highly recommended to work in teams and that you start early — always trying to be ahead of schedule.

## Prerequisites

- This is a master's course!
- Brain

<aside class="notes">
By now, this course is notorious for requiring a lot of effort.
The legends are true; I am indeed expecting a decent level of skill from all of you.
This is a master's course after all.

While I don't care whether you have officially finished your bachelor, you should only take this course if you are certain that you meet the prerequisites.
</aside>

- - -

- Fluent in C (or C++, or Go, or Rust, or Haskell)
    - General programming mindset
    - Knowing your tools

- Algorithms and data structures
    - Graphs + traversal

- Operating systems
    - Utilising your software stack

- Assembly (preferably x86)

<aside class="notes">
Since this course is very programming intensive, you need to be fluent in one of these languages.
If you choose C and think strings are compared using `==` you'll have a very hard time.

For OS, if you think calling `exec` without `fork` while implementing a library is a good idea, maybe consider revisiting the OS course.

- Software development
    - Version control system
    - Build systems
    - Testing

- Project management
    - Organisation
    - Team communication

<aside class="notes">
As already mentioned, the schedule is quite tight, hence good organisation and software development skills are paramount.

- Formal languages and automata theory
    - Grammars + transformations
    - Lexer / parser

<aside class="notes">
I also recommend doing this course only after having completed FLAT.
The lecture and proseminar assumes that you are familiar with the basics of grammars (plus related transformations), lexers, and parsers.
